Electron Symfony
================

This simple project allows to run a Symfony application inside Electron.
It's simply a default Electron build (see https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start)
with gulp-connect-php, needed to run PHP.
Indeed, you can use this to run any PHP application, not just a Symfony one.

You need npm installed on your machine to get this working.
